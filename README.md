## üìå Project Status: Architectural Design & Public Specification

Welcome to **BERR**, the public home for the design, specification, and eventual implementation of the Berrmili cryptographic framework.

**Note:** Source code has not yet been published. We believe that robust cryptographic systems are born from transparent, auditable, and formally reasoned design. This repository serves as a public forum for specification drafts, architectural models, and community feedback before any code is committed.

## üöÄ The Vision: A New Foundation for Secure Software

The demand for secure, private-by-default applications has never been greater. Yet developers often face a trade-off: either use brittle, low-level cryptographic primitives prone to misuse, or rely on monolithic, application-specific protocols with limited flexibility. **BERR eliminates this compromise.**

BERR is a **general-purpose cryptographic framework** designed to empower developers in building diverse, end-to-end secure systems ‚Äî ranging from secure messaging to IoT, decentralized applications, and collaborative real-time systems ‚Äî all with post-quantum security guarantees.

## üîç What Makes BERR Different?

| Feature                   | Conventional Approach (e.g., Signal Protocol)                               | BERR Framework Approach                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Scope & Purpose**        | Specialized protocol for **secure messaging**.                              | General-purpose, composable **framework** for secure applications: messaging, IoT, collaborative apps, decentralized systems, etc.                      |
| **Architecture**           | Tightly integrated and monolithic.                                           | **Explicitly composable**: Developers select formal handshake patterns (e.g., `IK`, `XX`) matching their application's trust model.                     |
| **Post-Quantum Security**  | Post-quantum upgrades as extensions or forks.                                | **Post-Quantum Native**: Hybrid cryptography (classical + PQC) is default and baked into Layer 0.                                                       |
| **Core Vision**            | Focused primarily on secure message transport.                              | Extends to **state synchronization (CRDTs)** and **privacy-preserving proofs** (e.g., Private Set Intersection).                                        |

## üìñ Threat Model

**BERR is designed under the assumption of a Dolev-Yao network adversary model**:
- Adversary has full control over the network: can intercept, drop, replay, reorder, or inject messages.
- Passive and active attacks are both in scope.
- Post-compromise security (PCS) and forward secrecy (FS) are supported where applicable.
- Side-channel attacks (timing, power analysis) are explicitly out of scope for the initial framework design but should be addressed at implementation and deployment level.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Core Security Principles

### üîí Misuse-Resistance by Design
- Nonce management is fully automated.
- No API paths for unauthenticated encryption.
- Strongly typed key abstractions prevent accidental misuse (e.g., encryption keys cannot be used for signing).

### üßæ Transcript-Based Protocol Integrity & Replay Protection
- Every handshake and protocol message is hashed into a running **transcript state**.
- Each new key derivation depends on the **entire protocol history**.
- Replay attacks are prevented by transcript hash chaining and optional sequence numbers in transport messages.

### üõ°Ô∏è Aggressive Domain Separation
- All derived keys and secrets are **context-bound** by unique, human-readable labels (e.g., `berr-v1-handshake`).
- Enforced at the API and cryptographic primitive level.

### üé≤ Cryptographically Secure Randomness
- All cryptographic operations requiring randomness (e.g., ephemeral key generation, nonce seeds) rely on a secure entropy source (e.g., OS-provided CSPRNG via libsodium, Rust `rand_core` + hardware entropy where available).
- Entropy quality is validated at runtime.
